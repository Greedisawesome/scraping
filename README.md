# scraping
This is my first project. Aim of it is to get data about sales of antiques in the internet and then analyse it and probably build a predictive model

I'm using Python with Request and BeuatifulSoup libraries to get the data from the Internet, Numpy, Pandas and MathPlotLib for analysing and visualising it
